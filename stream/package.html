<p>A streaming parser implementation and related tools for JSON. Implements a
streaming pull parser with the following components:</p>
<h2>Stream Reader</h2>
<p>{@code JSONStreamReader} provides an implementation of a streaming pull-parser,
similar to JSR 353 for JavaEE, or the Jackson JSON parser. The stream reader
reads strictly conforming JSON data, and has "hooks" to allow reading of
long data, such as base64-encoded data within a JSON string.</p>
<p>This reader should be considered when the source JSON data is from a known
safe origin.</p>
<h2>Object Builder</h2>
<p>{@code JSONObjectBuilder} is a builder of JSONObject and JSONArray structures
built on top of the stream reader. The implementation ends up simpler than
{@code JSONTokener}, mainly because a lot of the heavy lifting is done in the
stream reader.</p>
<h2>Limit Stream Reader</h2>
<p>{@code JSONLimitStreamReader} provides a stream reader that is better at
dealing with JSON data from untrusted origins, such as unknown internet
connections. It is build with deliberate boundaries that avoid memory exhaustion
and other data storage limits, for the purposes of denial-of-service attacks.</p>
<h2>Limit Object Builder</h2>
<p>{@code JSONLimitBuilder} is built on top of the limit stream reader above,
it limits its use of the runtime stack to avoid stack smashing attempts from
untrusted JSON sources.</p>
<p>This parser may be slower than the other object builder above -- &lt;20%
in informal testing -- due to its use of trampolining for creating nested
structures.</p>
<h2>Builder Limits</h2>
<p>{@code BuilderLimits} limits that are applied to a limit stream reader and
limit object builder. These are based on similar limits found in secure
XML processing parsers.</p>
<h2>Limit Filter</h2>
<p>{@code LimitFilter} provides an easy interface for accepting or rejecting
particular structures during a JSON parse process.</p>
